  The History of Samoa is an interesting history. It shows a beautiful transition between the old and new Samoa. 
  Although we maintain our old tradition and culture, we have come to evolve into new changes, especially in religion. Samoa consists of two beautiful islands, Tutuila and Upolu. 
  These two islands are located in the South Pacific between Hawaii and New Zealand. Samoa is known for its rich plantation, wealth, and culture.
